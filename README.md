Automated Selenium Login Test Case with Python


This repository contains an automated test case that tests the login functionality of a web application using **Selenium** and **Python**. The test case opens a demo e-commerce site, logs in with valid credentials, and verifies that the login was successful by checking the page title.

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Python**: Install Python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Selenium**: Install the Selenium package using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install selenium
  ```

WebDriver: Selenium requires a browser driver. For Chrome, you can install ChromeDriver using:
```bash
pip install webdriver-manager
```
